ok, i want to plan out how we can upload all of the stuff in next.lifeitself.org/programs to residencies node type on wordpress server. read through PLAN.md, what we learn about author/team node type in PLAN-authors.md and also in research and let's start planning this out. we'll put the plan in PLAN-residencies.md once we are finished.

As a first guess, I note that we need to determine how we create posts of a specific post type on the server and what existing residency ones look like. I think they have certain fields and information. Then we want to look in the, so one job is just to work out how we create an individual residency on the server and what kind of data structure we need locally to do that.

Then the second task is to look in the subdirectory of next.lifeitself.org and /programs and see how we would convert these over into a form that works.

- Check if they have consistent front-matter or if you can adjust as needed
- Note: we have subdirectory here but we can flatten all of these together i think.

Then we wire this together.
