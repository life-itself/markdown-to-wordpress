    "content": "<p>Discover Europe&rsquo;s inspiring eco communities and ecovillages with us. Join our journey through 10 remarkable intentional communities that redefine our connection with the environment, emphasising sustainability and conscious co-living.</p>\n<p>In an era marked by ecological sustainability concerns and a growing desire for conscious co-living, eco communities have emerged as beacons of hope and inspiration. These intentional communities embody the principles of eco-consciousness, emphasising sustainability, communal living, and harmonious coexistence with the environment. Europe boasts a diverse tapestry of eco communities pioneering innovative ways of sustainable living. From the lush hills of Ireland to the sun-soaked landscapes of Portugal, join us on a journey through 10 remarkable European eco communities reshaping our relationship with the planet.</p>\n<p>But before we dive in, let&rsquo;s understand the distinction between an ecovillage and an eco community. </p>\n<p>An ecovillage is an intentional, traditional, or urban community consciously designing its pathway through locally owned, participatory processes, aiming to address the Ecovillage Principles taken from <a href=\"https://ecovillage.org/ecovillages/\">The Global Ecovillage Network</a> in the four areas of regeneration (social, culture, ecology, economy) into a whole systems design. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, an eco community has a broader scope and may encompass a variety of intentional communities prioritising ecological sustainability but may not strictly adhere to the ecovillage model. Eco communities can include intentional neighbourhoods, co-housing projects, or even urban communities with a shared commitment to eco-friendly practices.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-cloughjordan-ecovillage-ireland\">1.

    "title": "Governance at Life Itself: v2",
    "slug": "governance-at-life-itself-v2",
    "content": "<h1 id=\"executive-summary\">Executive Summary</h1>\n<p>Life Itself was initiated in 2015 by Sylvie Barbier and Rufus Pollock and were joined by co-founder Liam Kavanagh a year later. With the ongoing growth of Life Itself as a community and enterprise it behoves us to put in place solid foundations for our future development as well as provide transparency. Our motivating question is: what are the governance structures, patterns and practices we should put in place that would support and provide clarity on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A sense of ownership, fairness and trust amongst the nucleus, its members, and the broader community.</li>\n<li>People investing their time, energy and goodwill in the vision, mission and values of Life Itself to be recognised.</li>\n<li>Preserve and enhance Life Itself’s reputation.</li>\n<li>Staying true to the deepest elements of its vision, mission, values and culture, whilst being able to evolve in line with circumstance.</li>\n<li>Being able to live on beyond its founders and a balance between creating a vibrant and dynamic community with members being able to be more autonomous</li>\n<li>Clear reciprocal relationships with associated projects (eg: London Hub, LEAP, Datopian, Institute, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"our-hypothesis\">Our Hypothesis</h2>\n<p>We propose to address these intentions by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating an explicit membership model</li>\n<li>Establishing a board</li>\n<li>Creating separate voting and revenue shares with a formula for assessing contribution and allocating new revenue shares based on contribution</li>\n<li>Setting out clear community agreements</li>\n<li>Creating template agreements for associated initiatives and spaces and test these out with the London Hub and at least two projects e.g. the LEAP and Datopian</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"membership\">Membership</h1>\n<p>Our intention is to create membership structure which reflects the vision of Life Itself – where people experience being part of something, contributing and being contributed to and living the Life Itself vision and mission through our key <a href=\"/culture/\">values</a>.</p>\n<p>The other intention of the model is to reflect and recognise the different level of involvement and contribution to Life Itself by its members.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-you-become-a-member-of-the-community-and-how-does-it-work\">How do you become a member of the community and how does it work?</h2>\n<p>⚠ We don&rsquo;t yet have a formal membership process distinct from hub residency or becoming a team member. We interpret membership broadly to include Pioneers, Contributors and even many sympathizers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"levels-of-involvement\">Levels of involvement</h2>\n<p>While you are a member of a Life Itself “family” group, each member might have different level of involvement with Life Itself. Therefore within a family you may find people with various levels. Below is a drawing and explanation of the different criterias for each level:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSSLGMjGemTOB1cNKNwPlC6fP3GDtTAgxpU-FHvleOujfHy2nwBqSqKnh7jcWhMvAMTorblW_qOnAyX/pub?w=579&amp;h=528\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"level-1-sympathizers\">Level 1 Sympathizers</h3>\n<p>You are actively (or quietly!) supporting the aims and/or way of being up to those actively contributing material or other resources to the effort.</p>\n<h3 id=\"level-2-contributor\">Level 2 Contributor</h3>\n<p>A contributor is someone who does one or more of following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>does sustained “work” (remunerated / unremunerated)</li>\n<li>produces a workshop /event with us and who we (both they and us) want to continue collaborating</li>\n<li>has done some major support (e.g. helped us get funding) and they live for at least a month</li>\n<li>Someone resident in a hub and is actively engaged (on community calls), volunteers time and/or acts as an ambassador</li>\n<li>Substantive contribution to artistic or intellectual output</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"level-3-pioneer\">Level 3 Pioneer</h3>\n<p>A Pioneer who is among the first to explore or settle a new country or area. One of the first to do something. Life Itself Pioneers are actively involved in pioneering Life Itself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"membership-agreement\">Membership agreement</h2>\n<p>As a member, you agree to the following as part of being part of the community:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To live according to the values of Life Itself</li>\n<li>Not to gossip about other members of the community.</li>\n<li>To take collective responsibility for the care and wellbeing of the “family” as a whole and it’s individuals.</li>\n<li>To be aligned and supportive of the vision and mission of Life Itself.</li>\n<li>Not to withhold communications or intentionally cause upsets.</li>\n<li>If you have any issue or problem with Life Itself, you will responsibly communicate only to the person who can resolve that issue.</li>\n<li>You agree to join the quarterly community day and join at least one community call a month</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"communicating-resolving-conflicts\">Communicating &amp; Resolving Conflicts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>“Getting complete”, emotional “cleaning” and conflict resolution is a priority in our community.</li>\n<li>We believe that unspoken resentment and unresolved disagreements cause blocked relationships that damage the community.</li>\n<li>We seek to create safe spaces for each other and to learn tools such as meditation, integrity (restoration), flower watering (acknowledgement), non-violent communication and sharing to help us transform conflict into positive growth.</li>\n<li>We are determined to show-up to each other, not hide from things for convenience, when we have a chance to address issues in a sufficiently safe and kind space.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"shares-revenue-and-voting\">Shares, Revenue and Voting</h1>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Life Itself consists of a company limited by shares and a non-profit company limited by guarantee. The core Life Itself entity will probably operate more like a CIC (community interest company) than a traditional for-profit company though the exact legal structure is to be worked out. Specifically, classic CIC principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asset lock: the assets held by Life Itself can not be liquidated and distributed except to another entity pursuing the same purpose and mission.</li>\n<li>Distribution to pioneers will be set at a low level, sufficient only to attract necessary capital (for example, repayment of initial investment plus X% a year)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"principles\">Principles</h2>\n<p>Life Itself in it’s governance stand on three principles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Recognition of value</li>\n<li>Recognition of risk</li>\n<li>Fair but not equal</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"recognition-of-value\">Recognition of value</h3>\n<p>We believe that there are many more values than monetary ones. Our goal is to create a common yardstick to recognize and remunerate the value members contribute to Life Itself (eg: wellness, art, time, expertise, money…)</p>\n<p>The principal is that the more you put in the more you get out:</p>\n<p>value in =&gt; value out (in the form of either economical or voting shares)</p>\n<h3 id=\"recognition-of-risk\">Recognition of risk</h3>\n<p>Some people may invest energy and money when there is little cash around or people power / belief around – we want them to get compensated later.</p>\n<p>We see this under the form of two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Loans</li>\n<li>Equity (with a denominator on risk)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"fair-but-not-equal\">Fair but not equal</h3>\n<p>We want to recognize differential contribution so that people feel fairly treated and we have incentives; at the same time we want to “flatten” those incentives compared to the outside world. We want to incentivize effort and quality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"types-of-shares\">Types of Shares</h2>\n<p>There are two types of shares, voting shares and revenue shares. A member of Life Itself community can qualify for revenue and/or voting share when reaching L3.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Imgur\" src=\"/assets/images/OPrvrNS.png\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"fig-2-voting-and-revenue-shares-and-allocation-of-monies\">Fig 2: Voting and Revenue Shares and Allocation of Monies</h3>\n<h2 id=\"voting-shares\">Voting Shares</h2>\n<p>Voting shares have voting control by majority over the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vota A: Allocation of surplus between Initiatives, Dividends and the Rainy Day fund (subject to minimum provision)</li>\n<li>Vote B: Allocation of money between initiatives (this may be subject to management direction as well)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Allocation of Voting Shares is at the discretion of the board initially and will be related both to fiscal and non-fiscal contribution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"revenue-shares\">Revenue Shares</h2>\n<p>Ownership of revenue shares entitles the holder to dividends. Dividends are distributed in proportion to the proportion of revenue shares held (perhaps subject to max provisions - ie. no more than 20x the minimum distribution).</p>\n<h3 id=\"allocation-of-revenue-shares\">Allocation of Revenue Shares</h3>\n<p>Revenue shares are distributed to L3 members based on an assessment of their contribution.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Contribution points = Some function of (€, value, effort, skills + competence, joy)<ol>\n<li>€ = revenue generated, value = value generated etc</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Adjust contribution points towards equality (at some rate)<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Maybe allow for a mincome e.g. 5k a year and above proportional</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Contribution points determine proportional allocation of that years share issue</li>\n<li>That year share issue = f(value created / effort expended) * decay function (to reflect early risk and that stuff tends to grow)<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Easiest would be effort relative to the past i.e. share issue</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"simple-example\">Simple Example</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Life Itself run since Oct 2015</li>\n<li>\n<p>Proposed allocation (Rufus, Sylvie, Ninon, Liam): 40, 30, 15, 15</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>400 shares initial allocation =&gt; 160 / 120 / 60 / 60Example: future allocation]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>100 shares next year</p>\n</li>\n<li>Contribution (Rufus, Sylvie, Ninon, Liam): 15%, 30%, 15%, 40%</li>\n<li>Total: 160 + 15, 120 + 30, 60 + 15, 60 + 40</li>\n<li>Total: 175, 150, 75, 100</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"appendix-criteria-for-our-model-why-we-chose-it\">Appendix: Criteria for our model - why we chose it</h3>\n<p>What are the criteria we select on for our model?

There are two key aspects of a relationship of Life Itself with other initiatives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reputation &amp; Brand: e.g. how and when can associated initiatives use Life Itself’s brand?</li>\n<li>Economic: What, if any, economic relationship is there between the entitites? For example, does Life Itself have a financial stake in these other entities?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To address these questions, we intend to create an explicit agreement for entities to associate with Life Itself just as we have for members.</p>\n<p>We believe these relationships can be very important, especially economically, and will be a crucial mechanism for creating a dynamic and thriving Life Itself ecosystem.</p>\n<p>At present, we do not have a definite answer.

There&rsquo;s no right answer, both are useful in different ways, but it would be good to state here.</em></p>\n<p><em>E.g. How do you get invited to a gathering? Through invitation by a current Supporter after approval by their Family Facilitator or a Board Member.</em></p>\n<p>Life Itself obviously welcomes all kinds of participation. However for what we are terming members (and this phrasing or definition could change in future) this or something similar would be likely.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-major-initiative\">What is a (major) initiative?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A sequence of small workshops or meetings (e.g. 4+ project brunches)</li>\n<li>Organizing a major event e.g. 50+ people</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-would-the-asset-lock-operate\">How would the asset lock operate?</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There&rsquo;s potentially a conflict of interest in the structure for the asset lock: the directors responsible for policing the Asset Lock are also responsible for deciding how much dividend to pay themselves. Almost all organisations with an Asset Lock have a board that don&rsquo;t benefit financially for this reason.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We are continuing to think about this, especially as we set up the charity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-decisions-are-the-remit-of-the-board-and-what-decisions-are-the-remit-of-the-voting-pioneers\">What decisions are the remit of The Board, and what decisions are the remit of the Voting Pioneers?</h2>\n<p>Plan is voting pioneers would control things like allocations to projects from projects fund.</p>\n<p>At present, given the early stage of Life Itself we are operating a bit like Damanhur at the start where they had much more executive direction and we similarly incline to more authority to the board.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-about-other-self-development-conditions-for-board-members\">What about other self-development conditions for board members?</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At present, you specify doing the &ldquo;Landmark Forum” as a prerequisite for board participation. What about other similar personal growth work?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We encourage all forms of personal and professional development and transformation. At the same time, we find it very valuable for the Board to have some kind of shared foundation and common language to complement the different practices board members may be doing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-about-dividing-life-itself-into-two-complementary-orgs-associates-and-network\">What about dividing Life Itself into two complementary orgs – “associates” and “network”?</h2>\n<p>MAIN COMMENT: I think you may actually be best set up as two parallel organisations here. Art/Earth/Tech as I see it does two totally valuable but actually rather distinct things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Art/Earth/Tech Associates</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The for-profit arm with paid projects, investments and enterprises. It makes sense for this to be a select group of trusted people who actively want to work with each other. The top-down board structure you&rsquo;ve suggested is appropriate for this type of organisation.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Art/Earth/Tech Network</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The not-for-profit arm. A community of people. It would be great if this was a more democratic organisation so that members feel equal to one another. A member-led organisation would have a greater sense of ownership and fairness, and encourage more commitment and input from members. One way to do this would be for each family to elect their own facilitators (1 or 2 people), and that the board of the Life Itself Network to be made up of the family facilitators. The Life Itself Network would then be responsible for organising Gatherings, Springs, Family groups and peer-to-peer support on a not-for-profit basis.</p>\n<p>Basically, I think what Life Itself is doing is totally wonderful, but that the current structure conflates two quite distinct functions. I think that separating off the network as a more democratic service space where things are freely and generously given will attract lots more energy into the organisation, make it more sustainable and give it opportunities for great growth and to attract different types of funding. It will also mean that business arm can be a more simplified, streamlined organisation that can be justifiably exclusive.</p>\n<p>If the two types of organisations are mixed together, there&rsquo;s a risk of the lower levels of membership feeling disaffected and unmotivated. They could put in lots of voluntary work into an organisation that essentially the Level 3 founding members forever have control and ownership of.</p>\n<p>This is a longer point and one we have now had the chance to discuss more in person :-)</p>\n<p>Regarding the specific item here I think our concern was that one are balancing two risks (and two benefits)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That org &ldquo;goes bad&rdquo; (some set of people exploit others) or that risk of that puts off participation</li>\n<li>That org gets bogged own in horizontardism or gets hijacked by a clique and that or risk of that puts off participation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At present, we feel the set up we have balances these and also reflects fact that (based on our own experience) item 2 is a greater medium-term risk than item 1. We also think that the best way to guard against either of these is through our culture and being - no formal rules will be sufficient.</p>",

Contribute to the collective conversation by</strong> <a href=\"https://possibilitynow.org/\"><em>sending us your visions for a better society</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p>With 2021 beginning, we are looking back on a year in which the pandemic brought grief, hardship and anxiety. Many of us connected more deeply to our mortality and vulnerability, our needs for community and the pain we experience when separated from others. We experienced the impact of decisions made by our institutions, our governments, our loved ones and ourselves, on our physical health but also our emotional wellbeing. It was already clear we were part of a global community — the climate crisis, for example, reflects how our actions impact those we will never meet — but the pandemic has made our interconnectedness harder to ignore. It also created an immense rupture in ‘business as usual,’ bringing a time of strangeness and uncertainty.</p>\n<p>At Life Itself we have been asking how this period of disruption and increased awareness of our interconnectedness might spark a broader reassessment of the status quo, a consideration of — if and when we return to ‘normal’ — what we want that ‘normal’ to be. One thing is clear; we need to have these conversations together, because we cannot create alone what we can create when we are in conversation with one another. In April 2020 we launched the initiative <a href=\"https://possibilitynow.org/\">Possibility Now</a> — a call to action for dreamers, doers, thinkers and experimenters to share their visions of a world we could create together in the wake of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Our hope is that out of the global tragedy of the pandemic will arise a reawakened enthusiasm for exploring our collective hopes for humanity and bringing them into being together. When we get unstuck from our feelings of resignation, when we reconnect with our hopes and imaginations and see that others are dreaming and hoping and caring along with us, a window opens to a better future. What have we longed for, been moved by, lost patience with, or felt inspired to change this year? What do we believe is possible? What is worth striving for, because there’s a possibility? Our invitation to you is to contribute to this conversation by <a href=\"https://possibilitynow.org/\">sending us your visions for a better society</a>.</p>",
