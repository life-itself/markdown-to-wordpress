# Prompt

> I want you to create a list of all the content md filese in the root folder. I want a sense of which ones are substantive, which are duplicate or similar (if any). It owuld be good to have a title for each as well as the filename and a brief opinion/evaluation of their content in a markdown table. Put all of this together with recommendations for action into sandbox/review.md

# Output

Created a full inventory and appraisal of every root-level markdown file in sandbox/review.md:1-58, including titles, filenames, word counts, substance ratings, and brief qualitative notes. Highlighted overlaps (e.g., the three conscious- coliving course promos) and thin spots (metacrisis, jobs, people, contact, subscribe) so you can see at a glance which pieces are substantive versus light or stale.

Key opportunities called out in sandbox/review.md:52-58:

- Consolidate the conscious-coliving course CTAs into a single modular hub instead of three nearly identical pages.
- Audit time-sensitive promos (calls.md, hangouts.md, morning-creative-practice.md, relation-a-largent-et-histoires-de-vie.md, where-the-wild-things-are.md) to confirm what’s still live.
- Expand stub pages (metacrisis definition, hiring info, team display, contact/newsletter CTAs) so they feel as rich as the flagship narratives.
- Refresh institutional info for collaborators, the real-estate fund, and overlapping research/labs content.

Next steps you might take:

1. Decide which event/promo pages should be archived or rewritten.
2. Draft fuller copy (or embeds) for the stub pages identified.
3. Design a combined “Courses” or “Learning” landing page that can host the three conscious-coliving offerings without duplication.

## Recommendations

1. **Consolidate course promo pages:** `conscious-coliving-course.md`, `practical-conscious-coliving-course.md`, and `transforming-conflict-in-community-course.md` reuse the same tone and structure; consider a single "Courses" index with modular sections for each offering to reduce duplication and simplify maintenance.
2. **Audit time-bound event content:** `calls.md`, `hangouts.md`, `morning-creative-practice.md`, `relation-a-largent-et-histoires-de-vie.md`, and `where-the-wild-things-are.md` all reference specific dates or timings—verify what is still live and archive/refresh copy accordingly.
3. **Expand or refresh stubs:** `metacrisis.md`, `jobs.md`, `people.md`, `contact.md`, and `subscribe.md` would benefit from richer copy (e.g., defining the metacrisis, outlining hiring philosophy, surfacing team bios, embedding forms).
4. **Update institutional info:** `collaborators.md`, `real-estate-fund.md`, and `research`/`labs` pages should be reviewed for current partners, offerings, and to remove overlap or legacy references.
5. **Maintain flagship narratives:** Ensure high-traffic pieces like `about.md`, `conscious-coliving.md`, `community.md`, `second-renaissance.md`, and `index.md` stay synchronized with current strategy and CTAs, since they anchor many internal links.
