Situation:

- In an old version of Flowershow (self-hosted)
- Options:
    - Move to wordpress
    - Move to Flowershow cloud

Complication

- Not sure how to push markdown in lossless way to wordpress
- If we stay in flowershow we may have problems making things easily editable (or at least w/o breaking things)
