  Why our experimental gardens matter for building Life Itself hubs.

Launching our gardens requires patient iteration and lots of compost.

## Why gardens?

Gardens let us test regenerative ideas quickly. Here's what we have learned so far:

- Compost beats chemicals every time.
- Volunteers stay longer when they can take veggies home.

Here is a table style GFM example:

| Crop | Yield |
| ---- | ----- |
| Kale | 65kg  |
| Beans | 40kg |

Footnotes also work for deeper dives.[^soil]
