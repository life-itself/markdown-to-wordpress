# Placeholder Images for Testing

This directory contains placeholder images for testing the migration tool.

In a real migration, you would copy actual images from:
- lifeitself.org/content/assets/images/
- Or other image directories

For testing purposes, we'll create small placeholder files to simulate the process.

## Images referenced in sample content:
1. lifeitself-landingpage.webp (referenced in about.md)
2. community-gathering.jpg (referenced in community.md)
3. hub-space.jpg (referenced in community.md)
4. bergerac-hub.jpg (referenced in conscious-coliving-retreat.md)

These would normally be copied from the actual lifeitself.org repository.
