  "description": "The objective is to create **functional end-to-end tests** using **Node.js** to verify successful content migration from an old system to a new system. The tests must confirm that migrated pages exist (no 404s) and that the core content is **reasonably similar** despite underlying HTML differences. The tests should be executable via `npm test` using a standard Node testing framework (recommend vitest).",
