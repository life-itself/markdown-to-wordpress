Context: have existing NextJS site with JSX pages and i want to convert them to html + taildwind that i can use in flowershow.

I want you to take the pages/index.jsx resolve the imports to components where there is external content (not for anything fancy just the jsx/html) and turn this into one jsx file called index.jsx in the root of this repository.

I just *want* the html i don't care about any of the fancy js. I just want a dump in an index.html file of the concatenated jsx content. i know some of it won't work but i just want it but with imports for *substantial* hmtl content resolvedd e.g. import of the Hero and other major sections. but i don't care if helpers etc are missing. i want a file that just has html (jsx structure) but no imports etc.

I want you to convert index.jsx from jsx html style to normal html and output as index.md
