I want to use this node Substack API library and I want to try and script getting a list of posts into Markdown format locally using it (or any other means).

https://github.com/jakub-k-slys/substack-api/blob/main/docs/installation.md

The publication i want to pull from is this:

https://news.lifeitself.org/

Let's start of simply just getting the first 3 posts and putting them in a subfolder called "posts".

Let's log as we go along.

The cli can be called simply `substack.js`. and we'll call it like `node substack.js posts`
